Final user test

About
- by this point, I had added:
	. diegetic features - a Start screen with help button to show the player how to move around the scene and hit monsters
                      - Game over scene after lose the game
                      - a semi panel to show score, degree of Health as slider
	. sounds - background music, monster sounds
	. 3D Model - damaged cars, game endpoint ( Tunnel)


Test
- player could not see the endpoint of the game
- Player ask me to add the text that shows  available current bullets  while hitting 


Fixes
 - to prevent the player that he is in the end point of the game, I added a display panel with a yellow star and collider in the entrance of tunnel
 - I also added  the text canvas for available current bullets in the semi panel . when the player press to the headset to hit, the number of current bullets decreased automatically.
