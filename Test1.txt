First user test

 About
- at this point, I had the city  with some models in the scene, the user moved any way (auto walking), the monsters appeared .

Test
- the player felt like he was his normal height in the vr world
- He felt like the city was supposed to sketchy but it was noted that it wasn't quite so
- He didn't know how many monsters he killed
- finally, the player was able to break immersion by moving beyond the scene

Fixes
- I decreased the overall lighting of the city to reduce the need for environement and to give it a scarier feel
- I added a semi panel to show score, degree of Health as slider
- I added colliders to each  walls around the city so that the user did not leave the city
